## Overview

`RSMI-NE` employs state-of-the-art results for estimating mutual information (MI) by maximising its lower-bounds parametrised by deep neural networks [Poole et al. (2019), arXiv:1905.06922v1]. This allows it to overcome the severe limitations of the initial proposals for constructing real-space RG transformations by MI-maximization in [M. Koch-Janusz and Z. Ringel, Nature Phys. 14, 578-582 (2018), P.M. Lenggenhager et al., Phys.Rev. X 10, 011037 (2020)], and to reconstruct the relevant operators of the theory, as detailed in the manuscript accompanying this code [D.E. GÃ¶kmen, Z. Ringel, S.D. Huber and M. Koch-Janusz, "Statistical physics through the lens of real-space mutual information, arXiv:2101.11633"].
